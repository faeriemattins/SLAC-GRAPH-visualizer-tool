I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I think, for example, that high-risk sports like extreme mountain climbing are inherently selfish and should not be indulged. xtreme mountain climbing, like other sports that carry with them excessive danger, such as riding motorcycles without a helmet and handguns without a proper license,
 are too dangerous to be pursued as a sport. 
Before we examine these activities which are dangerous, let's define sport.
 Merriam-Webster defines ""sport"" as ""exercise intended to delight or amuse,"" and ""a game played according to the rules"". In other words, sport is something that is done for the enjoyment of doing it. Extreme mountain climbing is not, of course, an activity undertaken for enjoyment - it is undertaken for the purpose of, well, climbing mountains. This is quite a different matter from taking part in sports like running, swimming, cycling and volleyball. n these kinds of sports, people can stay healthy wand pretty safe hile working-out.
 Extreme mountain climbing, on the other hand, is akin to playing Russian roulette. eople who practice extreme mountain climbing hurt themselves,and others, if they are not experienced and adequately trained.
 The statistical probability of sustaining a serious injury is very high if one decides to climb a very high mountain without proper mountaineering accouterments. Moreover, in extreme mountain climbing, there is not often a well-trained support staff to help climbers in trouble. Considering all these factors, I conclude that some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. ",18,5,1,0,12,13,12,1,3,9,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.5555555555555556

Dwarves have mined the earth for centuries, creating huge underground cities and a lush eco-system beneath the surface.
 But when they finally come into contact with humans, their fabled underground wealth proves to be the least of humanityâ€™s worries. A civil war breaks out. 
On the surface, humans and elves live in peaceful coexistence.
 However behind the scenes there is a hatred between both groups. Elves are jealous of humans. Humans are overstepping their boundaries and are trying to rule the elves. 

Elves are slowly becoming a less powerful race and are losing land in the process. The humans are taking over their land similar to the way America was stolen from the Native Americans. 

The elves are secretly killing off humans and the humans don't even realize it. The elves are poisoning the water and food supply. Humans are dying one by one and the elves are beginning to get on even footing in terms of power. But are they too late?

The humans ended up figuring out how the elves were poisoning their supplies. They were furious. They decided that the elves needed to be dealt with. They began to fight back. One by one they started to eliminate the elf population. The elves had a large advantage in numbers, but that didn't matter. The humans were too strong and had too powerful of weaponry. The elves were losing their power and the humans were gaining it. The remaining elves decided to make a peace agreement with the humans. They would give up 70% of their land and keep 30% of their land. 
The elves were satisfied with the deal, but the humans soon made an amendment to it.
 They wanted all the remaining elves to move to a reservation where the elves could create their own laws and rules and live without any human interference. The elves reluctantly agreed and moved to the reservation. The conflict was over and the humans and elves didn't bother with each other ever again. So many lives were lost over a stupid conflict that could have ended in a compromise from the beginning.",31,3,14,0,14,16,14,2,4,10,0.0,0.45161290322580644,0.5135802469135803

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" I immediately whacked the bee off my shoulder and ran to my mother. Mom, a bee landed on me and actually spoke. My mother dismissed my seemingly preposterous story and told me to go back to my room and play. I did as I was told, but I couldn't stop thinking about that bee. I am certain that bee spoke to me. I wonder if it will happen again if I were to open the window a little wider? 
I opened the window and waited.

The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an experimental technology on me that transferred my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way. 

The day finally came where the bee scientists came to my room, connected a device behind my ear and transferred my consciousness into a finely dressed bee that was laying besides me. After the transfer, the king bee rose and flew off with his followers and mounted an unparalleled resistance to beat off the hornet invasion that threatened the bee king's kingdom.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, students should learn how to be independent and responsible. I think the crux of learning independence and responsibility comes from learning personal finance. I think it is important for students to learn how to manage their money and how to make good financial decisions. It's interesting, though, because most schools don't teach personal finance. In fact, most schools don't even teach economics. This is really unfortunate because plenty of students in America graduate high school without knowing how to balance a checkbook. This is a problem because they are going to be making financial decisions for the rest of their lives. And if they don't know how to manage their money, they are going to be making bad financial decisions. It's just going to be so problematic for the country if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults. We already have a debt problem in this country. Did you know that the average American household has more than $15,000 in credit card debt? And that's not even counting student loans. So if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults, we are going to have a lot more debt in this country. Debt could really threaten the future of the country, because if people don't have money to spend, then the economy is going to suffer. So I think that personal finance should be taught in schools. Even elementary school kids should be learning about money.  For example, they could have some play money to buy little toys with from a classroom store, and then they would be forced to learn about budgeting and saving. They could earn the play money through exhibiting good behavior. Then, when they get to middle school, they should be learning about how to manage their money in a more advanced manner. For example, a classroom activity could simulate taking out loans. And when they get to high school, they should be learning about personal finance in an even more advanced manner. For example, they could be given a budget and then they would have to figure out how to spend their money in a way that would allow them to not only pay for college tuition but also their future kids' expenses and their retirement. 

The most important thing that I learned in school was how to be a good writer. This is unfortunate because I don't think that writing is the most important thing that students should learn. As I stated previously,  personal finance should be the topic that is most important to learn about. I genuinely don't think I learned much that really affected my life or that will be helpful to me in the future, because I don't think I learned anything that will help me in my career. I'm not a writer by any means and in my job as a line cook, I don't need to be a good writer. All I need to do is follow recipes and cook food. I can definitely do that without being a good writer, and it doesn't take a genius to grill a hamburger or make a grilled cheese sandwich. But honestly, as a line cook I definitely have problems budgeting my money. I don't make a lot of money, so I have to be really careful with how I spend it. And it would have been invaluable to me to learn about personal finance in school. Now, all I can do is try to learn about it on my own. That's obviously really hard and I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it. So that is why I am making the case for personal finance to be taught in schools. It can really help people in the future, and make their lives more comfortable too.",42,6,8,1,27,46,31,15,0,31,0.023809523809523808,0.19047619047619047,0.34801136363636365

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs. 
Learning technology is also important because it helps people learn how to think outside the box.
 It can help you sharpen your problem solving skills. It can help you learn how to think logically and rationally, because you have to think like that to understand how computers work.

Technology is only growing more and more prominent in our lives, and isn't going away any time soon. So that is why I think that it is the most important to learn in school. Learn to live with it, and love it.",21,6,11,0,4,7,5,2,1,4,0.0,0.5238095238095238,0.49421965317919075

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. 

If you go into movies with an open mind then you probably won't be offended. I personally rarely get offended. I usually find it funny when people make fun of people like me. I don't think it's offensive. Some people will find it offensive obviously though. I just don't take entertainment too seriously. It's meant to make you forget the world so it's more fun to just go along with it, even if it is a little awkward sometimes. ",32,4,22,0,6,10,6,4,1,5,0.0,0.6875,0.5074183976261127

Instead, Earth is populated by a number of different tribes and clans.  The United States had continued its democratic traditions and technological advancements while in isolation.  It combated environmental issues, done space flights to Mars, perfected self driving cars and many other technologies while the rest of the world had simply gone downhill.
America is therefore a new and exciting place to live, while the rest of the world has become more primitive.
  While border security had been an issue before, now that people throughout the world found out what strides America had made, people started flocking to the borders.  The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.  He first had to make sure no one from the outside world could attack America, then he was going to try and open up trade with the rest of the world.  While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

But then President Young thought back to the days of the Donald Trump presidency, when he had built a wall with Mexico and not shown empathy with those who had good reason to escape their countries.  He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

Within 6 months, Young's plan was put into place.  Immigrants were considered and many had skills to further advance US interests.  Rather than getting the dregs of other countries, he found he was getting the best of the best.  American continued to advance over the years, and many other countries advanced as well, as the US shared technology and best practices around the globe.

How do you think technology â€” like apps, Netflix, social media and texting â€” affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, I think technology has a great impact on dating, and not just dating but in general just meeting new people. Whether its for dating or just trying to hang out with people. I have met a lot of friends that became real life friends, by playing online video game.

As far as dating, it really helps you to put yourself out there to meet people who are looking for the same thing as you, and often times have the same interests as you. Not to mention it speeds up the process of finding a date, or a potential partner.

I do have experience with dating and technology. As a matter of fact, I met my wife through a dating website and app. I don't think we would have met otherwise. We both had the same interests and hobbies, and we were both looking for someone to share our lives with. So we found each other, dated for awhile, and ended up getting married a couple of years later. Still happy also. 

Other technology can also have a great impact on any type of relationship also. Every sit back on the couch at night with your sweet heart and just relax while watching Netflix? Yup, that's using technology in your relationship. It can also help you understand your partner better as well. Maybe you want to surprise your partner with a gift. Get out your smartphone and order it online from Amazon or something. Again, technology just made your life a little easier. 
Technology can also be a great way to keep in touch with your partner.
 Through messaging apps you can still communicate while away from each other, to let each other know you both still care.

One day, the shapeshifter decided to put his plan into action. After all of his previous attempts at getting the woman to fall in love with him, he knew her likes and dislikes pretty well. He decided to take her to a restaurant that he knew she loved. He picked her up in his car, and they drove to the restaurant.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever.
